# Familywise Type I Error Rate Inflation

This repo contains code for the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) Shiny App which can be found under https://losener.shinyapps.io/fwer/.
The idea is to visually illustrate the inflation of the familywise type I error rate when executing multiple significance tests.
